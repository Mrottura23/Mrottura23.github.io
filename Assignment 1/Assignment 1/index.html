                      I am an 18 year old fresh out of high school student that enjoys gaming and a vast array of other interests such as Formula 1, go karting and AFL. I am a very passionate Ferrari and Melbourne supporter and look forward to the upcoming season of both Formula 1 and AFL. Living with me at home are my two favourite pets in the world, one being a budgie whose name is Jet who is 5 years old and the toy cavoodle whose name is Ruby. Both get along really well, although I fear one might eat the other, but they are both very curious in each other’s personality.

                    <h1>Interest In IT</h1>
                      <h5><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</b></h5>
                      <img src="images/Ai.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" style="float:right">
                      <p>During my early years of highschool, I began to think about what really interest me and how I could relate that to my further studies after highschool. As a casual gamer at the time, I started to notice that I was really interested in computers and networks, this interest started with the casual Linus Tech Tips videos on how to build a computer which led to myself specing, building and set up the required network for my very own gaming rig. In addition to this at home interest, my highschool also provided a Software development class during VCE which I performed very well in and topped the class in most assessments which further enhanced my interest in IT. Finally, after sharing a memorable experience of building a PC with my father and uncle, I still continue to learn about a vast array of useful tools and tricks that I can use to further excel my knowledge in information technology, from professionals in their respective fields being program management and network administration.
                      </p>
                      <h5><b> Was there a particular person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience.</b></h5>

                      <p>My father and Uncle who are work in Program management and network administration, respectfully, both sparked my interest into IT as they both have innovative and sophisticated home IT systems that I am very keen to learn about. Both brothers love to boast about who has the fastest download speeds or have the best home network setup and I have been able to learn about each individual setups and apply the knowledge that I have learned into my own local area network. I was offered a fantastic opportunity in year 10 as part of work experience, to attend the head office of Bunnings for the week and get an understanding of the IT systems they use to manage and share data across all their systems. I not only observed what sort of work being done but I also helped setting up devices for different team members in other departments of the company. By getting a hands-on experience into what it is like to not only setup ones system but to also connect it to the overall network was really intriguing and a great learning opportunity.
                      </p>

                      <h5><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b></h5>
                      <p>I chose to study at RMIT because it is close to the city as I am very with the where abouts of the different services that not only RMIT provides but that of the City. Furthermore, RMIT provides a very flexible studying timetable with being able to tailor your studying schedule to how every it best suits a certain individual, in my situation I can come into the city for a few of my classes on one day and complete the remaining classes online from the comfort of my own home. Additionally, my uncle who is heavily involved within the IT industry also attended RMIT post his highschool studies and highly accredited the possibilities that arise from studying here.
                      </p>
                      <h5><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></h5>
                      <p>After graduating RMIT with my Bachelor of Information Technology, I expect to be equipped with the tools to tackle industry grade problems either that be following down my ideal path of networking or if I decide to try cybersecurity within business or further development my small hobby of programming into a key attribute which I can use to development innovative and life changing technologies. On top of these industry specific skills, I also hope to be greatly equipped with keys skills such as working efficiently within a team and the motivation and determination to complete individual specific tasks.

            <h1>Project Idea</h1>
            <h4><b>Overview</b></h4>
            <p>My project idea is to create an application for passionate go kart racers like myself which we can use for a universal of karting tracks to not only record and compare lap times, but to also keep a ranking of which go kart racers are the best in the state/country/world. This application would be used on one’s mobile phone or computer device for which they can also be-friend others that they kart with keep track over each other as they improve to become the fastest go karting driver.
            </p>
            <img src="images/karting.jpg" width="390px" height="300px" style="float: right">
            <h4><b>Motivation</b></h4>
            <p>My passion as a Go Kart driver started in the later months of 2021 when my uncle and wider family would drive down to Sunshine to drive at AceKarts. This hobby began as a fun activity during my break between high school and university, but the more and more times we went karting, the more we improved and more competitive we got. To this day we still compete to get the quickest lap time of the session to we can claim to be the fastest drive of the night, but the only problem with this system is that getting a quick kart was the entire goal and key elements such as average top speed and consistently quick lap times was unable to be tracked. This is the key motivation into developing an application that myself and other go kart drivers a like can use to keep track of their performance and compare their true statistics to their friends and competitors alike rather than quickest single time.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Description</b></h4>
            <p>My project idea which I would like to create in order to equip all Go Kart drivers with the necessary data to not only improve their own racing but also to compare and challenge their rivals would be an application that collects data from a racer’s session. This data would include key information for an driver such as all their lap times within a session, average speed over the session, competitors, positions gained and lost and so much more. By collecting, it will help achieve another goal of this application which is to be able to rank a specific driver based on all the data that the application can record. This will give the users the ability to easily compare how they stand to other drivers. Furthermore, given that drivers from across the state/country/world won’t be racing at the exact same track, the users will be able to input which track they are competing/racing at and therefore be able to access information such as track records and other racers that compete at the same track. In order to store and access such a huge amount of information from vast array of different tracks and users, we would need to use a database in the cloud such as Amazon RDS (Relational Database services).
            The application must have a user-friendly design with the functional aspects to search for multiple track and access track data such as, number of corners, track distance, top drivers, etc. A user-friendly design is a key attribute of the project idea if we are to attract users into using the program and sticking with it for a long while until further updates are brought out to compete with competitor applications.
            </p>
            <img src="images/aws.png" width="350px" height="250px" style="float: right">
            <h4><b>Tools and Technologies</b></h4>
            <p>The application design would be created to cater as a phone app primarily as most users would be able to login into certain track when at the physical location and link their data to the existing timing systems. Although the phone app is the primary design, the application would be able to run a pc/laptop over the web which would provide the same information and usability as the phone app, but would be useful for those user’s that don’t have a mobile phone or one that is incompatible with the required software.
            By using a cloud-based database to store all of the collected data, we can integrate it into almost any existing system at certain hire tracks or personalised karting transponders to provide that data to the database. Furthermore, the database is easily manageable with the ability to actively record and process data without the need to a full time DBA (Database Admin). Additionally, by using a cloud database, updating and maintaining other critical software. However, there a few drawbacks when it comes to a cloud database, the cost of such a database can be expensive and given if the application were to reach an international level, then then it would be very costly at that scale. Also, large-spread outages can become a concern to the database, and it would be the responsibility of the service provider to reboot the system.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Skills Required</b></h4>
            <img src="images/appdev.jpeg" width="350px" height="250px" style="float: right">
            <p>App development would be the front and foremost skilled required in development of the application as this is the environment that the project idea has been based on. Popular mobile app development software such as Appy Pie or Zoho Creator, offer the ability to create apps with little to none coding experience. Furthermore, these bits of software allow the developer the ability to integrate data from other applications such as our Amazon RDS which easily allows for a relationship with a simple end-user app and an efficient and large-scale database system with the ability to store and sort data.
            Basic skills in database management may be needed in order to maintain and make adjustments to the database. However, most of the sort out for features such as security, compliance, performance and patching and upgrading are automatically managed by the sever itself which leaves the developer more time optimising and connecting existing systems to its database.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Outcome</b></h4>
            <p>With a successful project, the application could be released to all user’s within the large-scale area for which the cloud database can support. This development hopefully will have an impact on the way individual system that are already in place can interconnect via the cloud database to share its data and resources to their users. This application should hopefully solve the problem with users only being able to compete based on lap time and provide a more in-depth and competitive racing experience for all drivers alike.
